# Overview

This is a simple iOS productivity app that is essentially a to-do list with a spin. The user can add items to a list and then check them off as they are completed. Each item on the list is given a level of urgency by the user. Based on the level of urgency, the item has a point value attached to it. As users complete more urgent tasks first, they will earn more points. The score is displayed at the top of the screen. Each item on the list can be edited and more items can be add. The items also have themes that can be changed so that users can color code their tasks.
